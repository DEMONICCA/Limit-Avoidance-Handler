> [!NOTE]
> - Disables Android's thermal limits and manages memory in real-time to maintain consistent performance and system responsiveness.
<hr/>

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Features ‚ú®:  
> 1. Advanced thermal service termination with dynamic scanning of MediaTek, Qualcomm, and Android init directories for comprehensive coverage. ‚úîÔ∏è
> 2. Robust thermal zone configuration with no-cooler policy enforcement to maximize device performance. ‚úîÔ∏è
> 3. Selective termination of non-essential user processes, safeguarding critical system components like UI, launcher, and core apps. ‚úîÔ∏è
> 4. Full bypass of CPU/GPU thermal throttling through precise interface control with retry mechanisms for reliability. ‚úîÔ∏è
> 5. Efficient filesystem trimming across key partitions (/data, /cache, /system, etc.) to optimize I/O performance. ‚úîÔ∏è
> 6. Enhanced thermal node security by restricting file permissions to prevent unauthorized policy changes. ‚úîÔ∏è
> 7. Comprehensive reset of thermal-related system properties to suppress vendor/OEM restrictions effectively. ‚úîÔ∏è
> 8. Optimized CPU frequency management with prioritization of high-performance cores and PPM policy adjustments. ‚úîÔ∏è
> 9. Reliable process termination using staged SIGTERM/SIGKILL signals with retry loops for stubborn processes. ‚úîÔ∏è
> 10. Real-time suppression of thermal monitoring services, including HALs and daemons, for uninterrupted performance. ‚úîÔ∏è
<hr/>

> [!TIP]
> 1. Supports `Magisk` `KernelSU - NEXT` `APatch` and `SukiSU`.
> 2. Minimum Android `10 sdk 29`.
